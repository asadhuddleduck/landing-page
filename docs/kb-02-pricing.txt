COMPARISON CONTEXT

Compare the £497 Pilot to:
- A single billboard (often £1,000+ for a month with no targeting)
- A TV commercial (thousands of pounds for production alone)
- A month with a traditional agency (typically £2,000-5,000 per month)
- The Pilot includes everything: research, creative, campaign build, management, and a tracking report
