HOW HUDDLE DUCK IS DIFFERENT

THE ONE-LINE DIFFERENCE

Content agencies make your page look alive. The AI Ad Engine makes your locations feel busy.

WHAT A NORMAL AGENCY DOES

Most agencies sell content days and social media management. They post on your feeds and hope people notice. That is brand awareness work. It can look great, but it does not drive people through the door on its own.

How they measure success: content volume, views, likes, followers.
What the client pays for: a content calendar, a camera team, a steady stream of posts.
The hidden problem: a page can look active and still be quiet in-store. Views can go up while sales stay flat.

WHAT THE AI AD ENGINE DOES

The AI Ad Engine builds and runs AI ad campaigns for multi-location food and beverage brands. It runs ads that get people through the door. It does not manage your social media.

It works like this: you share your existing content, the AI researches your audience, your content is remixed into ads, and campaigns go live within 72 hours.

What makes it different from other agencies that use AI: It is not a generic AI company. It is an F&B advertising specialist that uses AI to move faster than any traditional agency could. The AI gives speed. The F&B specialism gives accuracy. You get both.

THE DASHBOARD

Trial clients get a performance report at the end of 3 weeks showing how their ads performed. Unlimited clients get a live dashboard showing campaign health, cost efficiency, and location-level breakdowns. Updated daily. The AI gets smarter over time about who to show your ads to.

WHAT THE AI AD ENGINE COVERS

- Audience research
- Ad creative (remixed from your existing content)
- Campaign build and launch
- Weekly optimisation
- Performance reporting

WHAT THE AI AD ENGINE DOES NOT COVER

- Social media management or daily posting
- Content days or photoshoots as the core service
- Guaranteed revenue outcomes (the system controls the ads, not your food, service, or staff)

WHY THE PRICE IS FAIR

A typical agency charges £2,000 to £5,000 per month for one location. The AI Ad Engine covers up to 50 locations for £1,300 per month. Or you can test it first with the £497 Trial.
