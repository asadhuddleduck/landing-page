HOW HUDDLE DUCK IS DIFFERENT

THE ONE-LINE DIFFERENCE

Content agencies make your page look alive. The AI Ad Engine makes your locations feel busy.

WHAT A NORMAL AGENCY SELLS (COMMODITY)

Typical restaurant social media agencies sell some combination of:
- Filming days, shoots, and content production packages
- Editing, posting consistently (3 times a week, daily, etc.)
- Captions and hashtags
- Growing the page
- Community management

How they measure success: Content volume, views, likes, followers, consistency.
What the client pays for: A content calendar, a camera team, a predictable output of posts.
The hidden problem: A page can look active and still be quiet in-store. Views can go up while sales stay flat.

WHAT THE AI AD ENGINE DOES (NON-COMMODITY)

The AI Ad Engine builds and runs an AI-accelerated advertising and conversion system for multi-location food and beverage brands. It does direct response for restaurants, not social media management.

How it works: Method-first. Frankenstein Creative, 72-hour turnaround, live dashboard, brief-based execution.

What makes the AI Ad Engine different from other agencies that use AI: It is not a generic AI company. It is an F&B advertising specialist that uses AI to move at a speed that would be physically impossible without it. The AI gives speed. The F&B specialism gives accuracy. Clients get both.

THE DASHBOARD DIFFERENCE

Every client gets a live performance dashboard showing exactly what their AI Ad Engine is doing: real campaign data, health scores, cost metrics, and location-level breakdowns. Full transparency, updated daily. No hiding behind vanity metrics.

WHAT THE AI AD ENGINE DOES (SCOPE)

- Build campaigns from existing content using AI (Frankenstein Creative)
- Turn existing content into high-performing ad variations using AI
- Set up tracking and reporting via the live client dashboard
- Optimise based on response and conversion metrics, not vanity metrics
- Deliver at AI speed: first assets in 72 hours, weekly creative refreshes, continuous testing

WHAT THE AI AD ENGINE DOES NOT DO (NON-SCOPE)

- It does not run feeds or manage daily posting
- It does not sell content days as the core service
- It does not guarantee specific revenue outcomes. The system controls the advertising; it does not control food, service, pricing, staff, or operations.

WHY THIS CANNOT BE PRICED LIKE A COMMODITY

A commodity agency prices hours and output (posts, edits, filming). The AI Ad Engine prices ownership of an outcome path: AI-accelerated research, strategy that chooses the angle, creative built specifically to convert, campaign build, conversion design, live dashboard tracking, and weekly iteration. That bundle is why people cannot accurately compare it to someone who posts on Instagram or someone who runs ads.
