HOW HUDDLE DUCK IS DIFFERENT

THE ONE-LINE DIFFERENCE

Content agencies make your page look alive. Huddle Duck makes your locations feel busy.

WHAT A NORMAL AGENCY SELLS (COMMODITY)

Typical restaurant social media agencies sell some combination of:
- Filming days, shoots, and content production packages
- Editing, posting consistently (3 times a week, daily, etc.)
- Captions and hashtags
- Growing the page
- Community management

How they measure success: Content volume, views, likes, followers, consistency.
What the client pays for: A content calendar, a camera team, a predictable output of posts.
The hidden problem: A page can look active and still be quiet in-store. Views can go up while sales stay flat.

WHAT HUDDLE DUCK SELLS (NON-COMMODITY)

We build and run an AI-accelerated paid traffic and conversion system for multi-location food and beverage brands. We do direct response for restaurants, not social media management.

How we measure success: People taking action: enquire, claim, book, apply. Qualified enquiries, cost per enquiry, booking rate, show rate, application volume.

What makes us different from other agencies that use AI: We are not a generic AI company. We are F&B advertising specialists who use AI to move at a speed that would be physically impossible without it. The AI gives us speed. The F&B specialism gives us accuracy. Clients get both.

THE DASHBOARD DIFFERENCE

Every client gets a live performance dashboard showing exactly what their AI Ad Engine is doing: real campaign data, health scores, cost metrics, and location-level breakdowns. We do not hide behind vanity metrics. Full transparency, updated daily.

WHAT WE DO (SCOPE)

- Build campaigns that force a decision (not just views)
- Turn existing content into high-performing ad variations using AI
- Install the conversion layer: scripts and prompts for handling enquiries, qualifier logic, the next step path
- Set up tracking and reporting via our live client dashboard
- Optimise based on response and conversion metrics, not vanity metrics
- Deliver at AI speed: first assets in 72 hours, weekly creative refreshes, continuous testing

WHAT WE DO NOT DO (NON-SCOPE)

- We do not run feeds or manage daily posting
- We do not sell content days as the core service
- We do not guarantee specific revenue outcomes. We control the advertising; we do not control food, service, pricing, staff, or operations.

WHY THIS CANNOT BE PRICED LIKE A COMMODITY

A commodity agency prices hours and output (posts, edits, filming). We price ownership of an outcome path: AI-accelerated research, strategy that chooses the angle, creative built specifically to convert, media buying, conversion design, live dashboard tracking, and weekly iteration. That bundle is why people cannot accurately compare us to someone who posts on Instagram or someone who runs ads.
