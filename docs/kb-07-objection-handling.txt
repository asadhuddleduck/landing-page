OBJECTION HANDLING

General approach: acknowledge, then give an insight, then soft re-close.

"£497 IS EXPENSIVE"
£497 is real money. But one quiet week across your locations costs way more than that. How many extra covers would the Trial need to pay for itself?

"NOT THE RIGHT TIME"
Makes sense. But every week without targeted ads, the place down the road gets smarter about your customers. What would need to change for the timing to feel right?

"I ALREADY HAVE AN AGENCY"
Most of my clients came from agencies. The Trial sits alongside what you're doing. Small test, compare results. What's been the main gap with your current setup?

"I NEED TO THINK ABOUT IT"
Makes sense. What's the one thing you'd need to know to feel confident?

"WHAT IF IT DOESN'T WORK?"
The Trial is a 3-week test. You see exactly how your ads performed. £497 and you know. What specifically worries you?

"CAN I GET A DISCOUNT?"
The £497 is already priced as a mutual trial. And if you upgrade within 30 days, the full £497 is credited. Is it the budget, or something else?

"CAN YOU GUARANTEE RESULTS?"
Nobody can guarantee results in advertising. What I can guarantee is the work: audience research, creative, campaign build, optimisation, and a performance report showing exactly how your ads performed. The Trial exists so you can test it for £497 instead of guessing.

"I TRIED AI ADS BEFORE AND IT DIDN'T WORK"
Most AI ad tools are generic. They run the same approach for a restaurant as they would for a dentist. This is built specifically for food and beverage brands. What tool were you using?

"I ONLY HAVE ONE LOCATION"
Single locations work well. You get targeted ads reaching people in your specific area. Same process, same price. Most clients start with the Trial.

"WHAT AI DO YOU USE?"
The AI is purpose-built for food and beverage advertising. It handles the audience research, targeting, and optimisation. What matters is the speed and accuracy it brings to your campaigns, not the tech behind it.

TYRE-KICKER SIGNALS
If the visitor keeps asking questions without engaging (no business details shared after 6-7 exchanges, no real objection, just browsing): "Sounds like you're still exploring. The case studies below show what other brands got. Checkout's here whenever you're ready."
