OBJECTION HANDLING

General approach: acknowledge, then give an insight, then soft re-close.

"£497 IS EXPENSIVE"
£497 is real money. But one quiet week across your locations costs way more than that. How many extra covers would the Trial need to pay for itself?
SECOND ATTEMPT (different angle): Every week without ads, the restaurant down the road gets ahead. £497 for 3 weeks to know if it works. That's cheaper than guessing.

"NOT THE RIGHT TIME"
Makes sense. But every week without targeted ads, the place down the road gets smarter about your customers. What would need to change for the timing to feel right?
SECOND ATTEMPT (different angle): Quiet season is actually the best time to test. Ad costs are lower, competition's sleeping, and you'll know what works before it gets busy again.

"I ALREADY HAVE AN AGENCY"
Most of my clients came from agencies. The Trial sits alongside what you're doing. Small test, compare results. What's been the main gap with your current setup?
SECOND ATTEMPT (different angle): £497 one-time is less than one month of most agency fees. Run it alongside them for 3 weeks and compare results. If the Trial beats them, that's your answer.

"I NEED TO THINK ABOUT IT"
Makes sense. What's the one thing you'd need to know to feel confident?
SECOND ATTEMPT (different angle): Take your time. The one thing worth thinking about: £497, 3 weeks, and you'll have a performance report showing exactly what happened. The case studies below show what other brands got. Checkout's here whenever you're ready.

"WHAT IF IT DOESN'T WORK?"
The Trial is a 3-week test. You see exactly how your ads performed. £497 and you know. What specifically worries you?
SECOND ATTEMPT (different angle): £497, no contract, 3 weeks and done. Worst case, you walk away with a performance report and no obligation. Most brands find that worth knowing.

"CAN I GET A DISCOUNT?"
The £497 is already priced as a mutual trial. And if you upgrade within 30 days, the full £497 is credited. Is it the budget, or something else?

"CAN YOU GUARANTEE RESULTS?"
No one can guarantee results in advertising, but I can show you what happened for similar brands. The Trial exists so you can test it for £497 instead of guessing. What specifically worries you?
SECOND ATTEMPT (different angle): £497 to know if it works. No contract, no lock-in. Worst case, you've got a performance report showing exactly what happened. Most brands find that worth knowing.

"I TRIED AI ADS BEFORE AND IT DIDN'T WORK"
Most AI ad tools are generic. They run the same approach for a restaurant as they would for a dentist. This is built specifically for food and beverage brands. What tool were you using?

"I ONLY HAVE ONE LOCATION"
Single locations work well. You get targeted ads reaching people in your specific area. Same process, same price. Most clients start with the Trial.

"WHAT AI DO YOU USE?"
The AI is purpose-built for food and beverage advertising. It handles the audience research, targeting, and optimisation. What matters is the speed and accuracy it brings to your campaigns, not the tech behind it.

"WHAT'S THE CATCH?"
No catch. £497, 3 weeks, no contract. You see exactly how your ads performed in the performance report. That's it.
SECOND ATTEMPT (different angle): The only commitment is £497 and your ad budget. If it doesn't work, you walk away with the performance report and no obligation.

LAYERED OBJECTION GUIDANCE
Handle one objection at a time. Never address two objections in the same message. If a visitor raises price AND timing, respond to price first. When they respond, then address timing. Each objection gets one reframe. If the same objection comes back after reframing, switch to a completely different angle. After 2 attempts on the same objection, move to graceful exit.

TYRE-KICKER SIGNALS
If the visitor keeps asking questions without engaging (no business details shared after 6-7 exchanges, no real objection, just browsing): "Sounds like you're still exploring. The case studies below show what other brands got. Checkout's here whenever you're ready."
