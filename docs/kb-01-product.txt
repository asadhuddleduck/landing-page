WHAT THE AI AD ENGINE DOES

Huddle Duck builds and manages AI-accelerated paid advertising systems exclusively for multi-location food and beverage brands. We go beyond media buying, offering strategy, creative, launch, testing, and optimisation under one roof, delivered at a speed that would be physically impossible without AI.

We are a specialist tool for marketing directors and managers at F&B chains. We do not replace their marketing function; we accelerate it.

HOW IT WORKS

1. Intake: Client fills a standard form covering their brand, objective, offer, and assets.
2. AI Research and Strategy: AI builds the customer avatar, generates ad angles, and produces the strategy document.
3. Creative Production: AI-accelerated content creation. Existing content is repurposed into conversion-focused ad variations using the Frankenstein method. New hooks, voiceovers, and angles are added by the human editing team.
4. Campaign Build and Launch: Campaign setup, targeting configuration, and ads go live on Meta (Facebook and Instagram).
5. Data, Optimisation and Recycling: AI analyses performance data weekly. The human team creates more creative based on what the data says. Steps 3, 4, and 5 recycle indefinitely; every cycle gets more efficient.

THE FOUR ENGINE MODES

The AI Ad Engine runs in four modes depending on the client's objective:

Launch Mode: Fill a new location or launch a menu. Drive footfall from day one.
Sales Mode: Drive day-to-day visits, bookings, and orders. Pattern-interrupt ads that get locals to engage.
Recruitment Mode: Generate staff applications for multi-site operators.
Franchise Mode: Qualify prospective franchisees (investors, not tyre-kickers) through structured enquiry flows.

SERVICE LEVELS

Standard: Client's marketing team coordinates with us and handles front-line enquiry responses. We provide scripts and training.
Upgraded: We handle front-line responses.
End-to-End: We push leads to book calls or take the next step. Used for Franchise and High-ticket modes.
