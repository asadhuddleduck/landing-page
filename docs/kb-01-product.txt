WHAT THE AI AD ENGINE DOES

The AI Ad Engine builds and manages AI-accelerated advertising systems exclusively for multi-location food and beverage brands. It goes beyond media buying, offering strategy, creative, launch, testing, and optimisation under one roof, delivered at a speed that would be physically impossible without AI.

The AI Ad Engine is a specialist tool for marketing directors and managers at F&B chains. It does not replace their marketing function; it accelerates it.

HOW IT WORKS

1. Intake: Client fills a standard form covering their brand, objective, offer, and assets.
2. AI Research and Strategy: AI builds the audience profile, generates ad angles, and produces the strategy document.
3. Creative Production: AI-accelerated content creation. Existing content is repurposed into conversion-focused ad variations using the Frankenstein method. New hooks, voiceovers, and angles are added by the human editing team.
4. Campaign Build and Launch: Campaign build, targeting configuration, and ads go live.
5. Data, Optimisation and Recycling: AI analyses performance data weekly. The human team creates more creative based on what the data says. Steps 3, 4, and 5 recycle indefinitely; every cycle gets more efficient.

KEY FACTS

- First campaign assets ready within 72 hours of onboarding
- Every client gets a live performance dashboard showing exactly what their AI Ad Engine is doing
- Real campaign data, health scores, cost metrics, and location-level breakdowns
- Full transparency, updated daily. No hiding behind vanity metrics.
- The dashboard shows campaign performance: health scores, cost metrics, location-level breakdowns.
- Existing content is repurposed, not AI-generated content from scratch. Their food, their brand, their voice.
- AI handles the research, targeting, and optimisation. Humans handle editing, strategy decisions, and client relationships.

WHAT THE AI AD ENGINE DOES NOT DO

- It does not run social media feeds or manage daily posting
- It does not sell content days as the core service
- It does not guarantee specific revenue outcomes. The system controls the advertising; it does not control food, service, pricing, staff, or operations.
