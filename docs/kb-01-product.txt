WHAT THE AI AD ENGINE DOES

The AI Ad Engine builds and manages AI-accelerated advertising systems exclusively for multi-location food and beverage brands. It goes beyond media buying, offering strategy, creative, launch, testing, and optimisation under one roof, delivered at a speed that would be physically impossible without AI.

The AI Ad Engine is a specialist tool for marketing directors and managers at F&B chains. It does not replace their marketing function; it accelerates it.

HOW IT WORKS

1. Intake: Client fills a standard form covering their brand, objective, offer, and assets.
2. AI Research and Strategy: AI builds the audience profile, generates ad angles, and produces the strategy document.
3. Creative Production: AI-accelerated content creation. Existing content is repurposed into conversion-focused ad variations using the Frankenstein method. New hooks, voiceovers, and angles are added by the human editing team.
4. Campaign Build and Launch: Campaign build, targeting configuration, and ads go live.
5. Data, Optimisation and Recycling: AI analyses performance data weekly. The human team creates more creative based on what the data says. Steps 3, 4, and 5 recycle indefinitely; every cycle gets more efficient.

THE FOUR ENGINE MODES

The AI Ad Engine runs in four modes depending on the client's objective:

Launch Mode: Fill a new location or launch a menu. Drive footfall from day one.
Sales Mode: Drive day-to-day visits, bookings, and orders. Pattern-interrupt ads that get locals to engage.
Recruitment Mode: Generate staff applications for multi-site operators.
Franchise Mode: Qualify prospective franchisees (investors, not tyre-kickers) through structured enquiry flows.

SERVICE LEVELS

Standard: Client's marketing team coordinates with the AI Ad Engine and handles front-line enquiry responses. Scripts and training are provided.
Upgraded: Front-line responses are handled.
End-to-End: Leads are pushed to book calls or take the next step. Used for Franchise and High-ticket modes.

KEY FACTS

- Real campaign data, health scores, cost metrics, and location-level breakdowns
- Full transparency, updated daily. No hiding behind vanity metrics.

WHAT THE AI AD ENGINE DOES NOT DO

- It does not run social media feeds or manage daily posting
- It does not sell content days as the core service
- It does not guarantee specific revenue outcomes. The system controls the advertising; it does not control food, service, pricing, staff, or operations.
