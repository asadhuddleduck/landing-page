FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS

Q: WHAT DO I GET FOR £497?
A: A fully managed 3-week AI ad campaign. The AI researches your audience. I remix your existing content into ads. Campaigns are built, launched, and optimised weekly. At the end, you get a performance report showing how your ads performed and a strategy review.

Q: IS AD BUDGET INCLUDED IN THE PRICE?
A: No. The £497 covers strategy, creative, and campaign management. You pay your ad budget separately, direct to Meta. Minimum is £10 per location per day. For a single location, your total cost is £497 plus roughly £210 in ad budget over 3 weeks.

Q: HOW IS THIS DIFFERENT FROM A MARKETING AGENCY?
A: A typical agency charges £2,000 to £5,000 per month, takes weeks to onboard, and runs the same approach for every client. The AI Ad Engine researches your specific audience and local market before a single ad goes live. First assets are ready within 72 hours. The Trial is £497 for 3 weeks of fully managed AI ad campaigns.

Q: WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THE TRIAL ENDS?
A: You have two options. Upgrade to AI Ad Engine Unlimited at £1,300 per month for ongoing campaigns, a live campaign dashboard, and monthly reviews. Month-to-month, cancel any time. Or take what you learned from the performance report and run things yourself. Your £497 Trial fee is credited if you upgrade within 30 days.

Q: IS THERE A LONG-TERM CONTRACT?
A: No. The Trial is a one-time payment. Unlimited is month-to-month. No lock-in, no cancellation fees, no notice period.

Q: DOES THE PRICE CHANGE IF I HAVE MULTIPLE LOCATIONS?
A: No. Same price whether you have 2 locations or 50. Each location gets its own targeting and campaigns tailored to its local area. For 50+ locations, enterprise pricing is available.

Q: IS THIS AVAILABLE OUTSIDE THE UK?
A: Yes. The AI Ad Engine works globally. UK is the primary market. UAE and Dubai are secondary markets. The system works anywhere AI ad campaigns can run on Meta.

Q: WHAT IF I DO NOT HAVE MUCH CONTENT?
A: You need some existing content — photos or videos of your food, your locations, or your team. Even a handful of images from your social media can work. If you have nothing at all, the creative step cannot happen.

Q: HOW QUICKLY CAN I START?
A: First campaign assets are ready within 72 hours of onboarding. The Trial runs for 3 weeks once campaigns go live.

Q: WHAT PLATFORMS DO THE ADS RUN ON?
A: Meta — Facebook and Instagram. I use Meta's tools to reach your specific audience in each location.

Q: WILL MY ADS LOOK LIKE THEY WERE MADE BY AI?
A: No. Content is not generated from scratch. I remix your existing content into ads. Your food, your brand, your voice. The AI handles the research, targeting, and optimisation. The creative is always built from your real content.

Q: WHAT IF IT DOES NOT WORK?
A: The Trial is a 3-week test. You see exactly how your ads performed. If it does not work, you have spent £497 and you know. No contracts, no ongoing commitment. That is why the process starts with a Trial.

Q: WHO RUNS THE CAMPAIGNS DAY-TO-DAY?
A: The AI handles research, targeting, and optimisation. Editing, strategy decisions, and client relationships are handled separately. You do not need to manage anything yourself.

Q: WHAT DO I NEED TO GET STARTED?
A: Pay the £497 Trial fee on the website. Then fill in the intake form and share your existing content. That is it. No call needed.
