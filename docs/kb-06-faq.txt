FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS

WHAT IS THE AI AD ENGINE PILOT?
A 3-week managed advertising engagement where we research your customer avatar, produce ad creative (copy, voiceover, video), build and launch Meta campaigns, optimise weekly, and deliver a tracking report with a strategy review. Think of it as a mutual trial: you see what we can do, and we see if your business is a fit for ongoing management.

HOW LONG DOES THE PILOT RUN?
The managed campaign runs for 3 weeks from launch day. Before that, there is a research and creative production phase where we build your avatar and assets. After the 3-week run, you receive a full tracking report and strategy review call.

WHAT PLATFORMS DO YOU ADVERTISE ON?
We use Meta (Facebook and Instagram), but not the way most agencies do. Most agencies run standard Meta ads, which rarely work for food businesses. Our AI uses Meta's API as a delivery vehicle to reach a specific customer avatar at scale. The strategy is the avatar research and targeting. Meta is just how we deliver it.

DO I NEED TO PROVIDE AD CREATIVE OR A BUDGET?
We produce all creative (ad copy, voiceover scripts, and video assets) as part of the Pilot. We repurpose your existing content into conversion-focused ad variations. You do need to cover your own ad spend separately, with a minimum of £10 per location per day to Meta. The £497 Pilot fee covers our strategy, production, and management work.

WILL MY ADS LOOK LIKE THEY WERE MADE BY AI?
No. We never generate AI content from scratch. Your customers can spot that instantly and it erodes trust. Instead, we take your existing social media content and remake it into conversion-focused ad variations. Your food, your brand, your voice. The AI handles the research, targeting, and optimisation. The creative is always built from real content.

HOW IS THIS DIFFERENT FROM HIRING A MARKETING AGENCY?
A traditional agency charges £2,000 to £5,000 per month, takes weeks to onboard, and runs generic playbooks. Our AI deep-researches your specific audience, competitors, and market before a single ad goes live. You get a strategy built on data, not guesswork, at a fraction of the cost. The Pilot is £497 for 3 weeks of fully managed campaigns. Compare that to a single billboard, a TV commercial, or a month with a traditional agency.

WHAT HAPPENS AFTER THE PILOT ENDS?
You can upgrade to ongoing management. Month-to-month, no long-term contracts. Your £497 Pilot fee is fully credited when you upgrade within 30 days. The retainer is £1,300 per month. Or you can take the insights from your tracking report and run campaigns yourself.

IS THIS AVAILABLE OUTSIDE THE UK?
Yes. We work globally. UK is our primary market, with UAE and Dubai as secondary markets. The AI Ad Engine works anywhere Meta ads run.

WHAT IF WE DO NOT HAVE MUCH SOCIAL MEDIA CONTENT TO REPURPOSE?
We can work with minimal content, but it helps to have some. We will assess during the Pilot intake what you have available. Even a handful of food photos or short clips from your social media can be repurposed into effective ad variations.

HOW QUICKLY CAN WE START?
First campaign assets are ready within 72 hours of onboarding. The Pilot itself runs for 3 weeks once campaigns go live.

CAN WE RUN THIS FOR JUST ONE LOCATION?
Yes. The Pilot can focus on one location. The system is designed for multi-location scale, but works fine for individual location campaigns too.

DO YOU WORK WITH ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGE BRANDS?
Our core focus is non-alcoholic F&B brands: restaurants, cafes, dessert shops, burger brands, QSR chains, and similar concepts. Alcoholic beverage brands may have additional advertising restrictions on Meta that could limit campaign effectiveness.

WHAT IF IT DOES NOT WORK?
The Pilot is a 3-week test. You will see real data within that time. If it is not working, you have spent £497 and you know. No contracts, no ongoing commitment. That is exactly why we start with a Pilot instead of asking for a retainer upfront.
