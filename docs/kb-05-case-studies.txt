CASE STUDIES AND PROOF

Important: These are what our clients reported. We share them as track record, never as promises or guarantees. Every business is different.

PHAT BUNS (15+ locations, international burger brand)
Their marketing director asked if we would be another agency that charges a retainer while collecting data. We told him the results would be instant. Three days after launch, his Uber Eats rep called in shock. Sales had spiked across every single location. Not one store. All of them. Phat Buns rated us 10 out of 10.

DOUGH CLUB (pizza brand, multiple locations)
Dough Club did not exist yet when we started. No menu. No customers. No reputation. We launched their campaigns and built 12,000 followers on Instagram before they served their first slice. Sold out for weeks. Then we launched their second location. Queue on day one. Third location. Queue on day one. Every single time.

BURGER AND SAUCE (burger chain, multiple locations)
Burger and Sauce wanted proof before committing. We said give us a small test budget. One campaign. Within 8 days, hundreds of new customers walked through their doors. Months later, those same people are still coming back. One test. Hundreds of new faces. Repeat business that keeps growing. Burger and Sauce rated us 10 out of 10.

SHAKEDOWN (milkshake brand, grew from 1 to 5 locations)
When we started with Shakedown, they had one location. Now they have five. Every time they open somewhere new, our campaigns bring the crowd. The Newcastle launch saw 600 clicks in hours. Over 4,000 people showed up in a city where not a single person had heard of them before our ads went live. Shakedown rated us 10 out of 10.

CHAI GREEN (chai brand, franchise expansion)
Chai Green had been building for almost ten years. Steady, solid, respectable. After we implemented our systems, they experienced the most explosive growth period since starting. Franchise locations tripled compared to the previous period. Their top three reels went from a few thousand views to over 1 million. The visibility made franchise sales easier than they had ever been.

ANONYMOUS CAFE FRANCHISE (franchise lead generation campaign)
A multi-location cafe brand came to us wanting to expand through franchising. They needed serious investors, not tyre-kickers. We built a single campaign. Total spend: £8,500. Results: 676 franchise enquiries across instant forms and direct messages. 1.27 million impressions. Cost per lead: £12.56. Of those leads, 62 had six-figure capital ready to deploy. From a single campaign that cost less than a month's rent.

FAR EAST KITCHENS (restaurant)
A restaurant owner jumped on camera to name exactly who helped them grow. No script. No teleprompter. Just real words from someone who had seen the results first-hand.

LUNAR PARK (restaurant)
Lunar Park did not just rate us 10 out of 10. They went and made an entire video about working with us. That is the kind of relationship we build.

BOO BURGER (burger brand)
Boo Burger gave us a perfect score, then sent two more brands our way. They have since tried to refer countless others.

ANONYMOUS CLIENT — DEMAND OVERFLOW
We were at the gym. A client kept calling. Then calling again. We picked up. They were not angry. They were begging us to pull the campaign. Too many customers, too fast.

ANONYMOUS CLIENT — VIRAL MENU ITEM
We ran a targeted campaign around a single signature dish for one of our clients. It went viral. The kitchen could not keep up with orders.

ANONYMOUS CLIENT — THE DROP-OFF
One client paused our campaigns. Within days their views, reach, and engagement dropped to a fraction of what they were. The only thing that changed was us.
