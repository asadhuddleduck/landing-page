CASE STUDIES

These are what clients reported. They are shared as track record, not as promises or guarantees. Every business is different.

PHAT BUNS (15+ locations, burger brand)
Phat Buns had 15+ locations and had been through agencies before. They started with a Trial, rated the service 10 out of 10, and became the longest and highest-value client.

DOUGH CLUB (pizza brand, multiple locations)
Dough Club launched with no customers and no reputation. AI ad campaigns built a local audience before each location opened, so every new site had people ready to walk in from day one.

BURGER AND SAUCE (burger chain, multiple locations)
Burger and Sauce were cautious after being let down by past agencies. They tested one AI ad campaign using their existing content and stayed on after the Trial.

SHAKEDOWN (milkshake brand, grew from 1 to 5 locations)
Shakedown used the AI Ad Engine for every new location opening. Each site launched with targeted AI ad campaigns already running in the local area, building awareness before and during each opening.

CHAI GREEN (chai brand, franchise expansion)
Chai Green had been building for almost ten years and wanted to expand through franchising. The AI Ad Engine built a franchise enquiry pipeline that filtered serious investor leads from casual enquiries.

FAR EAST KITCHENS (restaurant)
The owner jumped on camera unprompted to name who helped them grow. No script. Just real words from someone who saw the results first-hand.

LUNAR PARK (restaurant)
Lunar Park rated the service 10 out of 10 and made an entire video about working with the AI Ad Engine.

BOO BURGER (burger brand)
Boo Burger gave a perfect score, then referred two more brands. They have since tried to refer many others.

ANONYMOUS CLIENT: DEMAND OVERFLOW
One client asked to pause campaigns because demand scaled faster than expected. They needed time to catch up with orders.

ANONYMOUS CLIENT: THE DROP-OFF
One client paused campaigns. Within days their views, reach, and engagement dropped sharply. The only thing that changed was the AI Ad Engine. When the campaigns stopped, the results stopped.
