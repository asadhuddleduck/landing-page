CASE STUDIES AND PROOF

Important: These are what clients reported. They are shared as track record, never as promises or guarantees. Every business is different.

PHAT BUNS (15+ locations, international burger brand)
Their marketing director asked if this would be another agency that charges a retainer while collecting data. The AI Ad Engine launched campaigns within days. Phat Buns rated the service 10 out of 10 and stayed on after the Pilot.

DOUGH CLUB (pizza brand, multiple locations)
Dough Club did not exist yet when the AI Ad Engine started. No menu. No customers. No reputation. AI ad campaigns launched and built an audience before they served their first slice. Then the second location launched. Then the third. AI campaigns launched before every opening day. Built local awareness from zero in each area.

BURGER AND SAUCE (burger chain, multiple locations)
Burger and Sauce wanted proof before committing. A small test was agreed. One AI ad campaign. Campaign was live within days using their existing content. Burger and Sauce stayed on after the Pilot.

SHAKEDOWN (milkshake brand, grew from 1 to 5 locations)
When the AI Ad Engine started with Shakedown, they had one location. Now they have five. Every new location opened with AI campaigns running. Built awareness in each new area.

CHAI GREEN (chai brand, franchise expansion)
Chai Green had been building for almost ten years. Steady, solid, respectable. After the AI Ad Engine was implemented, the franchise enquiry pipeline went live. The AI Ad Engine built the franchise enquiry flow. Qualified investor leads.

ANONYMOUS CAFE FRANCHISE (franchise lead generation campaign)
A multi-location cafe brand wanted to expand through franchising. They needed serious investors, not tyre-kickers. The AI Ad Engine built an investor qualification flow. A single AI ad campaign filtered serious prospects from tyre-kickers effectively.

FAR EAST KITCHENS (restaurant)
A restaurant owner jumped on camera to name exactly who helped them grow. No script. No teleprompter. Just real words from someone who had seen the results first-hand.

LUNAR PARK (restaurant)
Lunar Park did not just rate the service 10 out of 10. They made an entire video about working with the AI Ad Engine. That is the kind of relationship that gets built.

BOO BURGER (burger brand)
Boo Burger gave a perfect score, then sent two more brands. They have since tried to refer countless others.

ANONYMOUS CLIENT: DEMAND OVERFLOW
A client kept calling. Campaign scaled faster than expected. Client asked to pause to catch up with demand.

ANONYMOUS CLIENT: VIRAL MENU ITEM
Targeted campaign around a single signature dish generated more interest than expected.

ANONYMOUS CLIENT: THE DROP-OFF
One client paused campaigns. Within days their views, reach, and engagement dropped to a fraction of what they were. The only thing that changed was the AI Ad Engine.
