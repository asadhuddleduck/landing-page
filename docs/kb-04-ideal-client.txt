WHO THE AI AD ENGINE WORKS WITH

PRIMARY AVATAR: THE MARKETING DIRECTOR OR MARKETING MANAGER

The AI Ad Engine works with food and beverage businesses (non-alcoholic) that have physical locations. This includes restaurants, cafes, dessert shops, burger brands, QSR chains, delivery kitchens, and similar F&B concepts.

The primary buyer is the Marketing Director or Marketing Manager: the person who makes marketing decisions and coordinates day-to-day marketing execution. They report to a CEO or Founder but have autonomy over marketing spend and agency relationships.

Multi-location brands with 5 or more locations are ideal. Brands with 3 or more locations are considered case by case. Single-location brands can still purchase the Pilot.

Why the marketing director matters: The best and longest-lasting client relationships are with marketing directors who use the AI Ad Engine as a specialist tool in their arsenal. They send a brief, the system executes. They do not need hand-holding. They need a reliable, specialist instrument that delivers when activated.

SECONDARY AVATAR: THE FOUNDER-OPERATOR

In some markets (especially UAE and newer brands), the founder or CEO is the marketing decision-maker. This can work if they have multiple locations, are growth-focused, and have someone who can coordinate day-to-day.

THE AI AD ENGINE AS A TOOL FRAMING

In an ideal engagement, the marketing director sends a brief (for example: launching a new location in March, activate the AI Ad Engine in Launch Mode), and the system executes. The AI Ad Engine is one specialist tool in their marketing arsenal, not a replacement for their marketing function.

IDEAL CLIENT EXAMPLES

Phat Buns: 15+ locations. Marketing director with budget authority. Takes ownership. Longest, highest-spending client.

Burger and Sauce: Multiple locations. Marketing manager coordinates directly. Protects the relationship from internal noise.

Chai Green: Franchise brand. Tripled franchise locations.

Shakedown: Grew from 1 to 5 locations. Queue at every launch.

MARKETS

UK is the primary market. UAE and Dubai are secondary. The system works globally.

UAE specifics: Primary buyer is often the founder or CEO. WhatsApp-first communication culture. Key pain points include aggregator dependency (Talabat, Deliveroo commissions), high rent, and staff turnover.

WHO THE AI AD ENGINE DOES NOT WORK WITH

- Businesses outside food and beverage
- F&B brands still in the planning phase with no operational location
- Anyone who wants social media management (posting, stories, community management) rather than AI ad campaigns
