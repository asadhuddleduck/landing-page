WHO THE AI AD ENGINE WORKS WITH

PRIMARY CLIENT: THE MARKETING DIRECTOR OR MARKETING MANAGER

This person works at an F&B brand with multiple locations. They manage the marketing team and budget. They have tried agencies before or run ads in-house. They want a faster, more reliable way to run AI ad campaigns across all their locations.

They usually have existing content (photos, videos, brand assets) but need help turning it into ads that get people through the door.

Multi-location brands with 5 or more locations are ideal. Brands with 3 or more are considered case by case. Single-location brands can still buy the Trial.

SECONDARY CLIENT: THE FOUNDER-OPERATOR

In some markets, the founder or CEO makes the marketing decisions. This works if they have multiple locations, are focused on growth, and have someone who can coordinate day-to-day.

They are often stretched thin. They need something that works without taking up their time every week.

THE AI AD ENGINE IS A TOOL, NOT AN AGENCY

In an ideal setup, the marketing director sends a brief. For example: "We are launching a new location in March. Activate the AI Ad Engine for a launch campaign." The system then executes. The AI Ad Engine is one specialist tool in their marketing toolkit. It does not replace their marketing function.

IDEAL CLIENT EXAMPLES

- Phat Buns: 15+ locations. Marketing director with budget authority. Longest, highest-value client.
- Burger and Sauce: Multiple locations. Marketing manager coordinates directly.
- Chai Green: Franchise brand. Used the AI Ad Engine for franchise expansion campaigns.
- Shakedown: Grew from 1 to 5 locations. AI ad campaigns running before every launch.

MARKETS

UK is the primary market. UAE and Dubai are secondary. The system works globally. Campaigns run on Meta (Facebook and Instagram).

In the UAE, the primary buyer is often the founder or CEO. Key concerns include aggregator dependency (Talabat, Deliveroo commissions), high rent, and staff turnover.

WHO THE AI AD ENGINE DOES NOT WORK WITH

- Businesses outside food and beverage.
- F&B brands still in the planning phase with no open location.
- Anyone who wants social media management (posting, stories, community management) rather than AI ad campaigns.
- Businesses with no marketing budget allocated yet.

NOTE ON DELIVERY-ONLY AND DARK KITCHEN BRANDS

Delivery-only and dark kitchen brands can use the AI Ad Engine. The campaigns drive orders rather than footfall. The same system applies: audience research, creative, launch, and optimisation. These brands are not excluded.
