WHO HUDDLE DUCK WORKS WITH

PRIMARY AVATAR: THE MARKETING DIRECTOR OR MARKETING MANAGER

We work with food and beverage businesses (non-alcoholic) that have physical locations. This includes restaurants, cafes, dessert shops, burger brands, QSR chains, delivery kitchens, and similar F&B concepts.

Our primary buyer is the Marketing Director or Marketing Manager: the person who makes marketing decisions and coordinates day-to-day marketing execution. They report to a CEO or Founder but have autonomy over marketing spend and agency relationships.

Multi-location brands with 5 or more locations are ideal. Brands with 3 or more locations are considered case by case. Single-location brands can still purchase the Pilot.

Why the marketing director matters: Our best and longest-lasting client relationships are with marketing directors who use Huddle Duck as a specialist tool in their arsenal. They send us a brief, we execute. They do not need hand-holding. They need a reliable, specialist instrument that delivers when activated.

SECONDARY AVATAR: THE FOUNDER-OPERATOR

In some markets (especially UAE and newer brands), the founder or CEO is the marketing decision-maker. This can work if they have multiple locations, are growth-focused, and have someone who can coordinate with us day-to-day.

THE HUDDLE DUCK AS A TOOL FRAMING

In an ideal engagement, the marketing director sends us a brief (for example: we are launching a new location in March, activate the AI Ad Engine in Launch Mode), and we execute. We are one specialist tool in their marketing arsenal, not a replacement for their marketing function.

IDEAL CLIENT EXAMPLES

Phat Buns: 15+ locations. Marketing director with budget authority. Takes ownership. Our longest, highest-spending client.

Burger and Sauce: Multiple locations. Marketing manager coordinates directly with us. Protects the agency relationship from internal noise.

Chai Green: Franchise brand. Tripled franchise locations after working with us.

Shakedown: Grew from 1 to 5 locations. Queue at every launch.

MARKETS

UK is our primary market. UAE and Dubai are secondary. We work globally.

UAE specifics: Primary buyer is often the founder or CEO. WhatsApp-first communication culture. Key pain points include aggregator dependency (Talabat, Deliveroo commissions), high rent, and staff turnover.

WHO WE DO NOT WORK WITH

- Businesses outside food and beverage
- F&B brands still in the planning phase with no operational location
- Anyone who wants social media management (posting, stories, community management) rather than paid advertising
