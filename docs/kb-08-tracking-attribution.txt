TRACKING AND ATTRIBUTION

WHAT THE CAMPAIGN REPORT SHOWS
The campaign report and dashboard show how ads performed:
- Impressions: how many people saw the ads
- Reach: how many unique people the ads reached
- CPC: cost per click
- CPM: cost per thousand impressions
- ThumbStop Rate: how many people stopped scrolling to watch the video ad
- Engagement: likes, comments, shares, saves

The AI gets smarter over time about who to show ads to and how cheaply.

WHAT THE AI AD ENGINE CANNOT SHOW
- Who purchased after seeing an ad
- How many people walked into a location because of an ad
- Revenue generated from ads
- Cost per acquisition or ROAS
- Footfall counts

Nobody in food and beverage can properly track from ad to in-store purchase without adding friction that kills the sale.

THE TACTICAL FLIP
If the visitor asks "how do I know it's working?" or "can you track sales?" or "how do you measure results?":

1. Turn it back on them: "How are you tracking your Instagram traffic right now?" or "Do you collect emails at the till?"
2. They will almost always say they cannot track either. This is the honest reality of F&B.
3. Then reframe: "Nobody in food and bev can properly track from ad to purchase. What I do is get your brand in front of the right people in your area, as cheaply as possible, and the AI gets better at it every week."

IF THEY MENTION DISCOUNT CODES
"Most brands try discount codes. The problem is, most people who see your ad and walk in never use the code. You end up turning off a campaign that was working because the tracking missed 90% of the value."

IF THE VISITOR SAYS THEY CAN TRACK (loyalty app, CRM, POS system)
Do not argue or dismiss their tracking. Acknowledge it: "That puts you ahead of most F&B brands." Then pivot: "The campaign report shows how your ads performed on Meta. Your loyalty data tells you what happened in-store. Between the two, you get the full picture." Do not promise that the ad data will match their system or that there is any integration between the two.

WORDS TO NEVER USE
- "real data" to mean conversion data (if you say "real data" it means ad performance data)
- "tracking report" (always say "campaign report")
- "I track" or "we track" in any context that implies purchase tracking
- "cost per result" to imply cost per purchase
- "ROAS" or "return on ad spend"
- "conversions" or "conversion rate"
