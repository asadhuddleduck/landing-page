      <p className="founder-bio">
        I was born in Pakistan. Moved to the UK at nine when my dad got a job
        as an NHS doctor. Fell in love with space. I was one of the first kids
        in the country to sit an Astronomy GCSE, and astrophysics at university
        felt like the obvious next step. Then a friend asked why I hadn&apos;t
        become an Islamic scholar, and I didn&apos;t have a good answer. So I
        dropped out, crossed borders, and spent three years sleeping on marble
        floors in Karachi memorising texts older than most European capitals.
        Nights belonged to lunar calendars and mapping prayer times with the
        same precision astronomers once used to chart stars.

        I came back to the UK with no plan. A failed milkshake business. A TB
        hospitalisation. A junior accountant desk with Instagram ads running on
        the side at midnight. Somehow those ads started working. Really
        working. Queues of 4,000 people at restaurant launches. Brands growing
        from one location to five. 12,000 followers for a pizza shop before it
        served its first slice.

        Marble floors and star charts led here, and I still can&apos;t fully
        explain the path. But I think a brain trained in both scientific rigour
        and spiritual discipline just sees patterns other people miss.
